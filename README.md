# Build a protocol on a Trusted Location
Injecting trusted location data into dApps opens the door to several new types of applications.
The dapp we're going to build allows users to create location-based Airdrops,
that can be unlocked only by those devices that were within the specified location area of the Airdrop
during the time range determined by the Airdrop's creator.

# notes

      IoTeX is a full-stack platform that enables the use of trusted data from trusted devices
      in trusted decentralized applications (dApps). IoTeX combines blockchain, secure hardware,
      and a layer-2 infrastructure to empower privacy-focused devices, apps, and services. 
      
      MachineFi is the core methodology developed by IoTeX to financialize the utility 
      and data stream coming from machines, incentivize their deployment, and enable composable
      and transparent ways of building innovative applications.
      More information about MachineFi can be found in the MachineFi Vision Paper. 
      
      The core component of every MachineFi application is W3bstream:
      An off-chain computing infrastructure serving as an open, chain-agnostic
      and decentralized protocol sitting in between blockchain and devices to convert
      real-world data streams from devices into verifiable, dApp-ready proofs.
